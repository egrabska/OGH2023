# What are satellite image time series?

Satellite time series are a collection of repeated observations or measurements obtained by satellites over a specific geographical area over a period of time.
Although these observations are typically captured at regular intervals, they are often irregular, particularly in the case of optical imagery, due to for example cloudiness. Still, they can be used in a wide range of applications, telling us how different objects or places have changed over time.
